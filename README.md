# Logistic-Regression
**Logistic Regression for Binary Classification Problem**

This project implements a Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch to classify a dataset with two classes. The algorithm uses gradient descent to learn optimal weights and then evaluates its performance using accuracy and a classification report.

**Features**

- Generates synthetic binary classification data.

- Implements logistic regression using gradient descent.

- Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
